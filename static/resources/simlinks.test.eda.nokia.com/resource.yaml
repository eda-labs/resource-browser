                  When creating a SimLink with more than one member, the bondName is used to create a bond on the SimNode side.
                  This field must not be used when creating a single member SimLink.

                  To create a point to point link with a single interface on both sides use a single link object.
                  To create a point to point link with a LAG configured on both side, use two links with matching nodes.
                  A multihommed lag is created by using two or more links where the remoteNode and/or localNode can be different.
                  Creating a link with only localNode specified will create an edge interface.
